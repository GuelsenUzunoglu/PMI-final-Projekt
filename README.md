```bash
npm run build
```

### **2. Run the Production Server**
Preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## **Database Configuration**

BloomingGallery uses **DuckDB** as an embedded database.

### **Database Setup**
- The database file is stored in `data/project_database.db`.
- The database is initialized automatically when the project starts.

### **Manually Checking the Database**
To view saved images in DuckDB:
1. Install the DuckDB CLI (if not already installed).
2. Open the database:
   ```bash
   duckdb data/project_database.db
   ```
3. Run the following query to view all images:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM images;
   ```

---

## **Available npm Scripts**
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server on `http://localhost:5173`.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the project for production.
- **`npm run preview`**: Runs the production build in a local server environment.

---

## **Security and Authentication**
The app uses **bcrypt** (version 5.1.1) for securely hashing user passwords. Passwords are never stored in plain text.

To install bcrypt manually, if not already installed, run:
```bash
npm install bcrypt
```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Database Not Found**
- Ensure the `data/` directory exists:
  ```bash
  mkdir data
  ```
- Restart the server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

### **Problem: Images Not Displaying**
- Check if images are stored in `static/uploads`.
- Verify database entries with:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM images;
  ```
